    abstract = {Structural variations (SVs) and gene copy number variations (gCNVs) have contributed to crop evolution, domestication, and improvement. Here, we assembled 31 high-quality genomes of genetically diverse rice accessions. Coupling with two existing assemblies, we developed pan-genome-scale genomic resources including a graph-based genome, providing access to rice genomic variations. Specifically, we discovered 171,072 SVs and 25,549 gCNVs and used an Oryza glaberrima assembly to infer the derived states of SVs in the Oryza sativa population. Our analyses of SV formation mechanisms, impacts on gene expression, and distributions among subpopulations illustrate the utility of these resources for understanding how SVs and gCNVs shaped rice environmental adaptation and domestication. Our graph-based genome enabled genome-wide association study (GWAS)-based identification of phenotype-associated genetic variations undetectable when using only SNPs and a single reference assembly. Our work provides rich population-scale resources paired with easy-to-access tools to facilitate rice breeding as well as plant functional genomics and evolutionary biology research.},

    abstract = {Comparing genomic features among a large panel of individuals across the same species is considered nowadays a core part of the bioinformatics analyses. This typically involves a series of complex theoretical expressions to compare, intersect, extract symmetric differences between individuals within a large set of genotypes. Several publically available tools are capable of performing such tasks; however, due to the sheer size of variants being queried, such tasks can be computationally expensive with a runtime ranging from few minutes up to several hours depending on the dataset size. This makes existing tools unsuitable for interactive data query or as part of genomic data visualization platforms such as genome browsers. Tersect is a lightweight, high-performance command-line utility which interprets and applies flexible set theoretical expressions to sets of sequence variant data. It can be used both for interactive data exploration and as part of a larger pipeline thanks to its highly optimized storage and indexing algorithms for variant data.Tersect was implemented in C and released under the MIT license.

    abstract = {Motivation: Testing for correlations between different sets of genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research. However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner.Results: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.Availability and implementation: BEDTools was written in C++.

    abstract = {Summary: The variant call format (VCF) is a generic format for storing DNA polymorphism data such as SNPs, insertions, deletions and structural variants, together with rich annotations. VCF is usually stored in a compressed manner and can be indexed for fast data retrieval of variants from a range of positions on the reference genome. The format was developed for the 1000 Genomes Project, and has also been adopted by other projects such as UK10K, dbSNP and the NHLBI Exome Project. VCFtools is a software suite that implements various utilities for processing VCF files, including validation, merging, comparing and also provides a general Perl API.Availability:  http://vcftools.sourceforge.netContact:  rd@sanger.ac.uk},

	abstract = {We explored genetic variation by sequencing a selection of 84 tomato accessions and related wild species representative of the Lycopersicon, Arcanum, Eriopersicon and Neolycopersicon groups, which has yielded a huge amount of precious data on sequence diversity in the tomato clade. Three new reference genomes were reconstructed to support our comparative genome analyses. Comparative sequence alignment revealed group-, species- and accession-specific polymorphisms, explaining characteristic fruit traits and growth habits in the various cultivars. Using gene models from the annotated Heinz 1706 reference genome, we observed differences in the ratio between non-synonymous and synonymous SNPs (dN/dS) in fruit diversification and plant growth genes compared to a random set of genes, indicating positive selection and differences in selection pressure between crop accessions and wild species. In wild species, the number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) exceeds 10 million, i.e. 20-fold higher than found in most of the crop accessions, indicating dramatic genetic erosion of crop and heirloom tomatoes. In addition, the highest levels of heterozygosity were found for allogamous self-incompatible wild species, while facultative and autogamous self-compatible species display a lower heterozygosity level. Using whole-genome SNP information for maximum-likelihood analysis, we achieved complete tree resolution, whereas maximum-likelihood trees based on SNPs from ten fruit and growth genes show incomplete resolution for the crop accessions, partly due to the effect of heterozygous SNPs. Finally, results suggest that phylogenetic relationships are correlated with habitat, indicating the occurrence of geographical races within these groups, which is of practical importance for Solanum genome evolution studies.},

	abstract = {Root restriction is suitable for horticultural soilless cultivation characterized by high efficiency and quality in the case of high density and low node order pinching. However, little research is available on the mechanism of root restriction improving the flavor and nutritional quality of tomatoes. We investigated the effects of Extreme Root Restriction (ERR, 750 mL/plant) on the content of metabolites, activity of enzymes, and gene expression level involving sucrose metabolism in different clusters of two tomato types. The fruit diameter and single fruit weight of common tomato at CIII were reduced by 5.6\% and 14\% under ERR, as a result, the fruit uniformity throughout the whole plant was improved. The ERR enhanced the accumulation of metabolites in tomato fruits, such as soluble sugars, amino acids, vitamin C, lycopene, and polyphenol, which was caused by ‘concentration effect’ that occurred with a reduction of fruit size. The activities of enzymes (SS, SPS, NI, AI) at CIII and CIV of cherry tomatoes increased by 3–4 folds under ERR. ERR enhanced accumulation of sucrose, glucose, and fructose in tomato fruits not only by modulating activities of metabolizing enzymes but also by inducing the expression of sucrose metabolism genes, including sucrose synthase genes (SS1, SS3–6) in common tomato, fructokinase genes (FKs), hexokinase genes (HKs), and sucrose phosphate synthase genes (SPSs), in cherry tomato. The above results are expected to provide a theoretical basis for root restriction cultivation techniques and practical guidance for high-quality tomato production in industrialized cultivation.},

We report benchmark results empirically comparing server- and client-side rendering strategies, review the architecture and design considerations of JBrowse, and describe a simple wiki plug-in that allows users to upload and share annotation tracks.},
